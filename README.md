# MTEC2120_Final
 
This project consists of 3D assets that I modeled in Blender and vatious scripts, including a player controller that allows for movement and attacking, as well as keeping track of stamina and health, which, when depleted, displays a death message. The project contains multiple interactable objects, each of which triggers a special action and animation. The fireplace - an interactable object - is triggred with an animation event. There is backgroud music and certain audio interactions as well.
